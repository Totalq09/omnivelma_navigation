/**
@page build_and_run_sample Building and running a sample application

This step is needed to ensure that OpenNI was installed properly, and that the development environment 
is properly set up to enable you to build OpenNI-based applications.

To build and run a sample application:

@section build_and_run_sample_windows Windows

-# Make sure you have the latest Microsoft Platform SDK installed (You
		can currently download this via the following hyperlink: 
		<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a55b6b43-e24f-4ea3-a93e-40c0ec4f68e5&DisplayLang=en">Microsoft's
		Platform SDK Web Install</a>).
-# Open Windows Explorer (or your favorite file navigator), and browse to OpenNI installation directory 
		(default: C:\\Program Files\\OpenNI)
-# In OpenNI directory browse to: Samples\\NiSimpleViewer.
-# Open the suitable project file, NiSimpleViewer.vcxproj, and build the application. If the build
		fails, contact PrimeSense support.
-# After successfully building the project, before trying to run it, please ensure that the 
		SamplesConfig.xml file is correctly configured:
		-# Browse to the 'Data' directory (the default location of this directory is C:\\Program Files\\OpenNI\\Data).
		-# Open the SamplesConfig.xml for editing using a text editor (additional information can be found under @ref xmlscripts).

@note Throughout the sample applications tutorial you will encounter use of relative paths in the sample 
application source files. Note that when your application is executed from within a debugging environment 
such as Microsoft Visual Studio, paths which are not absolute may not be resolved relatively to the 
output executable.

@note Therefore, in order for the sample application to execute correctly in Debug mode, you should modify 
the Working Directory to be the sub-folder into which the executable is located.
You can also use Visual Studio's macro \$(TargetDir) instead of setting an actual path.

@note Use "Project Properties"->"Debugging"->"Working Directory" to set the value.

@section build_and_run_sample_linux Linux

-# Go to the folder from which you installed OpenNI.
-# Browse to Samples/NiSimpleRead
-# Run 'make'
-# The binary is output to ../Bin/$(platform)-Release/Sample-NiSimpleRead
-# Before trying to run it, please ensure that the SamplesConfig.xml file is correctly configured:
	-# Browse to Samples/Config directory
	-# Open the SamplesConfig.xml file for editing using a text editor (additional information can be found under @ref xmlscripts).
