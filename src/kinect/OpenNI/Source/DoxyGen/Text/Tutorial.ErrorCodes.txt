/**
@page error_codes Error codes

OpenNI errors mechanism is error codes. Every function that might fail has a return value of type @ref XnStatus.
A value of XN_STATUS_OK means the function has succeeded. Any other value means some kind of failure
has occurred.

For additional error information, one may use the function @ref xnGetStatusString(), which returns a human
readable description of the error, in English.

Some basic error codes can be found in file XnStatusCodes.h.

A normal usage of the error mechanism is checking if an error has occurred, and if so, print a message
and close the application:
@code
xn::Context context;
XnStatus nRetVal = context.Init();
if (nRetVal != XN_STATUS_OK)
{
	printf("Failed to initialize OpenNI: %s\n", xnGetStatusString(nRetVal));
	exit(-1);
}
@endcode
