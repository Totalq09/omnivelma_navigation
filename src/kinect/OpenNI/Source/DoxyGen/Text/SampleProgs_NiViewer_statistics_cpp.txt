	@section statistics_cpp_glb_decls Global Type Declarations for Statistics.cpp 	
	
		The XnPixelStatistics data structure is defined in Statistics.h of this sample program. 
		@code
			XnPixelStatistics* g_PixelStatistics = NULL;

			enum XnCollectionStatus
			{
				NOT_COLLECTING,
				SHOULD_COLLECT,
				COLLECTING,
				COLLECTION_ENDED,
			} g_StatisticsState;
		@endcode

	
	@section statistics_cpp_statisticsinit Function: statisticsInit() - Initializes the Statistics Collecting Mechanism
	
		This function initializes the statistics collecting mechanism.
		
		This function gets a saved @ref glos_frame_object DepthGenerator node's "frame object", assigning them to <code>pDepthMD</code>. The frame object is a snapshot of the generated data, saved as a metadata object, at a certain point in time. The @ref xn::OutputMetaData::Data() method gets a pointer to the data frame of the frame object saved in the metadata. 
		@code
			const DepthMetaData* pDepthMD = getDepthMetaData();
			if (pDepthMD != NULL)
			{
				g_PixelStatistics = new XnPixelStatistics[pDepthMD->FullXRes() * pDepthMD->FullYRes()];
			}
		@endcode		
		The above code uses the FullXRes() method to calculate the scaling factor between the depth map and the GL window. FullXRes() gets the full frame resolution, i.e., the entire field-of-view, ignoring cropping of the FOV in the scene.		
		
		In the following, the @ref xn::DepthGenerator::GetDeviceMaxDepth() method gets the maximum depth value that the DepthGenerator node can generate. The maximum depth value is a hardware specification of the sensor.
		@code		
			XnDepthPixel nMaxDepth = getDepthGenerator()->GetDeviceMaxDepth();
		@endcode		
	
	
	@section statistics_cpp_statisticsaddframe Function: statisticsAddFrame() - Adds a Further Data Frame to the Statistics Collection
	
		This function adds a further data frame to the statistics collection.
		
		This function uses OpenNI operation types that have already been described in this program sample.
