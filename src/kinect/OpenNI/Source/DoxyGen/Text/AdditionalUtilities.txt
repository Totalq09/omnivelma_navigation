/**
@page additional Additional Utilities

OpenNI has a framework, allowing:
- Portability over various architectures and operating systems.
- A USB access abstraction layer (provided with a driver for Microsoft Windows)
- Some basic data types (like list, hash, etc.)
- Log and Dumps system
- Memory and Performance profiling
- Events (allowing callbacks to be registered to a specific event)
- Scheduling of tasks

Those utilities are also available to any application using OpenNI. OpenNI guarentees backwards compatibility
for this framework (up to a certain extent, as opposed to OpenNI actual API, which guarentees full backwards
compatibility).
